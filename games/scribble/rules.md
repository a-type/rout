Scribble is _Rout_'s take on the classic party game, Telephone Pictionary. Players take turns drawing their take on a prompt, or describing what they see in someone's drawing. As the game goes on, you 'pass around' these descriptions and drawings to each player in a circle. Illustration gaffes and bizarre misinterpretations abound. It's a good time.

## Rounds

Each round you will draw one thing, and describe one thing. On the first round, there won't be any prompts; instead, you'll make something up on the spot. For each successive round (except the final "voting" round) you will be working from another player's prompt.

### Drawing

For draw prompts, use the provided canvas to draw your version of what the prompt says. Or, at least, do your best. You have three colors, three brush sizes, and no eraser.

Remember, it's more important to have fun than to give the next person a perfect and accurate drawing.

### Writing

For writing prompts, look at the provided drawing and describe what you see. Be specific! If it's a dog, what type of dog? What is the dog doing? Go further! What is the dog _feeling_? What are its politics? A good description is fun and leaves a lot up to the artist for interpretation.

### The final round

Once you've done enough drawing and describing, it's time to see how everyone got on. You'll be shown how other players responded to the prompts and drawings you created, and asked to provide a reaction. Reactions are emojis, and up to interpretation. Choose one that feels right to you.

## Game end

The game is over after scoring, and on the end screen you'll see who earned the most of each kind of reaction. You can also see the full sequence of each prompt and drawing.
