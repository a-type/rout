Hearts is a classic competitive trick-taking card game. Players try to avoid winning tricks containing _scored cards_: any card with a heart suit, and the Queen of Spades.

## Objective

The objective of Hearts is to score the fewest points by the end of the game. Players should aim to avoid scoring point cards in tricks, unless they are trying to _shoot the moon_.

## Setup

Hearts can play 3 to 5 players. If necessary, a few cards are removed from the deck before shuffling. Then, the entire deck is dealt evenly to all players.

## Passing cards

After dealing, players pass 3 cards to one other player, depending on which deal it is. You should give away cards you prefer not to have in your hand for the main trick-taking portion of the game. You will receive 3 cards from another player.

## Starting the first trick

After a deal, the player with the 2 of Clubs always begins the trick (except for games with 5 players, where the 3 of Clubs starts). Turns proceed in a defined, random player order from there.

## Playing on a trick

Once a trick is started, players _must_ follow suit with their played card, if they are able. If not, you may play any card from your hand. The only exception is that hearts may not be played on the first trick.

## Taking tricks

The player with the highest card on suit in the trick wins the trick and takes the cards. Players who played off-suit are not eligible to win the trick.

## Scoring

After a player takes a trick, any _scored cards_ in the trick are added to their total score. All other cards are discarded.

Each Heart card is worth 1 point. The Queen of Spades is worth 13 points.

Cards are not actually scored to your point total until the end of the round! Even if your score breaks 100 during the course of a round, you still have a chance to shoot the moon, or make another player take more points than you.

## Shooting the moon

There is a special case for scoring: if you collect every scoring card in the deck over the course of a round. If you do, rather than adding 26 points to your score, you instead _subtract_ 26 points. This is called "shooting the moon."

## Game end

The game ends when one player has reached 100 points. The player with the fewest points wins the game. In case of a tie, all players tied for fewest points are considered winners.
