Guess a number from 1 to 100. Sounds easy? Yeah, it is.

This is a test game for Rout mechanics and platform features. If you're playing it, you're either a developer or very mischievous.

## Turns

Each turn, you guess a number between 1 and 100. Repeats are allowed but not recommended.

### Turn resolution

After all players play their turn, each of them is given the over / under result of their guess. Further strategy to find the correct number is left to you!

## Winning

Whoever guesses the correct number wins. If multiple players guess it in the same round, they all win.

The game ends after anyone wins.
