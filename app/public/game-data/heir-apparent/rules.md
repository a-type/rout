In this strategy game, you must outbuild and outmaneuver your rivals and produce twelve artifacts before they do.

Heir Apparent plays like a simple turn-based strategy game.

# Objective

The goal of Heir Apparent is to produce twelve Artifacts before your opponents do. Artifacts are created by spending resources and assigning Units to various tasks within your fortress.

Watch out! Your rivals will be angling to disrupt your supplies and production. They may even attack and destroy parts of your fortress! If you want to win, you should be prepared to do the same.

# Gameplay

## Round 1: Building your fortress

At the beginning of the game, you spend the first round constructing a fortress. All players will use the same set of fortress pieces to build from their starting position on a randomly selected part of the map.

## Subsequent rounds

After the first round, the rest of the game begins. To start off every round, your Lodging tiles will produce one unit. You may assign each unit to an adjacent Tile. At the end of the round, Tiles occupied by units will produce an Effect, depending on the type of Tile.

## Game end

When any number of players reach 12 Artifacts during a round, the game ends. All players who achieve 12 Artifacts are crowned as the new regents. You may have to share the throne...

# Types of Tiles

## Fortress Tiles

The type of Tiles you place your Units on makes a big difference for the effectiveness and efficiency of your strategy. Each one has a different Effect when occupied.

### Lodging

Upgrades the Unit, but _prevents the spawning of another Unit._

**Health:** 10

### Workshop

If the occupying Unit carries Gold, Workshop increments your Artifact production gauge. Filling this gauge produces one Artifact.

If the occupying Unit does not carry Gold, Workshop does nothing.

**Health:** 6

### Wall

A wall is inert, but has high health and can protect your other Tiles.

**Health:** 20

### Ballista

If an enemy Unit is within range, the Ballista will fire on them for considerable damage. Good for protecting your fortress from siege.

**Damage:** 8
**Health:** 4

## Terrain Tiles

### Mountain

Prevents traversal by Units. Also blocks Ballista projectiles.

### Overgrowth

Hides a Unit from rivals, even if they can see the Overgrowth Tile.

### Deposit

When occupied by a Unit, that Unit gains 1 carried Gold. Each Unit can carry a limited amount of total Gold.

# Units

There are a couple types of Units. Lodging produces Infantry Units, but they can be incrementally upgraded by occupying a Lodging tile. If a Lodging tile is occupied, it cannot produce more Units.

The upgrade sequence is **Infantry** -> **Archer** -> **Cavalry**.

Cavalry cannot be upgraded further.

## Infantry

A basic Unit, Infantry can only attack a Unit or Tile by moving directly onto it, and does moderate damage. However, they have the highest carrying capacity, at 5 Gold.

**Damage:** 2
**Health:** 12

## Archer

Archers can attack other Units or Tiles up to 2 spaces away. They do minimal damage, though, and can only carry 2 Gold.

**Damage:** 1
**Health:** 10

## Cavalry

Cavalry are powerful Units which do high damage to other Units and Tiles. They can also move two spaces per round, but they will stop short if they encounter a Fortress Tile. Cavalry can carry 3 Gold.

**Damage:** 4
**Health:** 16

# Moving

Each round, you may move any Units under your control, according to their movement range and accessible terrain. Units may freely move through your own Fortress Tiles, but cannot pass through rival Fortress Tiles.

You may not

# Attacking Rivals

Offensive strategy is important to staying ahead of your rivals in Artifact production. Aim to disrupt their supply lines or destroy their Fortress directly to halt production.

Attacking other Units depends on the type of Unit you are attacking with.

- Infantry and Cavalry: move your Infantry or Cavalry onto the same Tile as the other Unit or Fortress Tile. This can happen even if you don't know the other Unit or Fortress Tile is there, such as in Overgrowth or Fog of War.
- Archer: after moving an Archer into position, tap it to begin an attack. You then select a target Tile within range to fire on at the end of the round.
- Ballista: occupy a Ballista with any Unit to enable it. You can then tap it to select a target Tile to fire upon at the end of the round.

## Evasion

Attacks on Units can be evaded if the opponent Unit moves out of the way during the round. Likewise, a double-bluff can occur, where you anticipate your rival's movement and attack the intended Tile instead.

## Resolving attacks

Once an attack has commenced, the power of each attacker is subtracted from the health of the attacked Unit or Tile for all involved parties. If any involved Unit or Tile is reduced to 0 health, it is removed from play.

## Melees

If you are playing with more than two people, you may be involved in attacks involving three or more parties at once! In these melees, all attacks are split between all viable targets.

For example, if a Blue Infantry, Red Infantry, and Yellow Cavalry all end a round on the same Tile, the following attacks are made:

- Blue Infantry attacks Red Infantry for half its damage (1 damage)
- Blue Infantry attacks Yellow Cavalry for half its damage (1 damage)
- Red Infantry attacks Blue Infantry for half its damage (1 damage)
- Red Infantry attacks Yellow Cavalry for half its damage (1 damage)
- Yellow Cavalry attacks Blue Infantry for half its damage (2 damage)
- Yellow Cavalry attacks Red Infantry for half its damage (2 damage)

Or, in another example, suppose 3 different Units all end the round on the same rival Fortress Tile. Each will split its attack power between the two rival Units and the Fortress Tile, applying 1/3 of its natural damage to each.

Likewise, if a Ballista were to fire on this position, all 3 Units would take 1/3 of the Ballista's damage.

## Archers and Fortress Tiles

Archers can move onto rival Fortress Tiles just like other Units. But while an Archer is occupying a rival Fortress Tile, it can only attack that Tile. This means you cannot move an Archer onto a rival's Fortress Tile and proceed to attack targets further within their fortress. It also means moving an Archer onto a rival Fortress Tile makes it simply a less powerful Infantry.
