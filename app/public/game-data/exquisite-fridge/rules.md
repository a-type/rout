A classic creative writing game with a twist. Collaborate with friends to write stories, but you can only see the latest paragraph... and you can only use the words we give you.

## The first round

To start the game, you are given a set of word tiles. It's up to you to start your story! Drag tiles from your pile into the box to play them. You can rearrange the order of played tiles as you like, or drag them back to your hand.

## Blank tiles {#blank-tiles}

Some tiles are blank. That means you get to decide what they say. Drag one of these tiles onto your play area to fill it in.

If you decide you don't want to play a filled in blank tile after all, drag it back to your hand and it will reset. You can also use this to change your word (or fix a typo).

## Submitting a turn

Once you're happy with your section, press the _Submit turn_ button. You can only submit if you've played _at least_ 5 words and _no more than_ 20 words.

Now it's time to wait for the next round.

## Continuing the story {#continuing-the-story}

After the first round, players pass around their stories. [You will also receive new words to replace the ones you used last round (marked with a star).]{#new-tiles}

You only get to see the latest section of the story, and who wrote it. Now, keep playing tiles from your hand to continue the narrative.

## Game end

After 14 rounds, the game comes to an end. We'll tell you which round is the last one so you can wrap up the tale.

After the last round is complete, the full stories are revealed.
