# Gunboats

Take command of a fleet of ships and battle your friends for sea supremacy!

Gunboats is a twist on a classic dueling boardgame, now with up to 4 players and more action.

## The board

The board is a grid of square spaces shared by all players. You won't be able to see your opponents' ships, and they could be right next to (or on top of) yours!

## Objective

Sinking opponents' ships wins you points. The first player with 100 points wins the game. If multiple people reach 100 on the same turn, the highest value wins -- or there's a tie.

## Game setup

To begin the game, you'll draft 3 ships. All players get the same ships. You can place them anywhere on the board.

## Turns

Each turn, you draft 3 actions from a provided set. The possible actions are:

- Place a new ship
- Move a ship
- Fire a shot

Each time you take an action, you must use it immediately.

### Placing a ship

The type of ship is shown on the card. Drag the card onto a square to place the ship there. You may then rotate the ship in any orientation.

### Moving a ship

Drag the card onto one of your ships to begin moving. You may rotate the ship in any direction around its center, then move it up to 3 spaces forward.

### Firing a shot

Drag the card onto one of your ships to fire a shot from that ship. Each ship has a maximum firing radius. A targeting reticle will appear, and you must then move that reticle to a valid space you want to fire on.
