/**
 * Implements caching logic for computed game state from round data.
 * Game history is immutable, so we can safely cache computed rounds
 * which are completed. However, we can't necessarily safely cache
 * the current round naively. We need to make sure the number
 * of turns is the same.
 *
 * This cache also provides a more convenient API for
 * dealing with the game state and abstracting the actual
 * computation portion, seed random, etc.
