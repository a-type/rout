          Fees, Payment, and Renewal
        </h2>
        <p class="layer-components:my-0 layer-components:leading-normal">
          <strong>Fees for Paid Services</strong> Some of our Services are
          offered for a fee. This section applies to any purchases of Paid
          Services.
        </p>
        <p class="layer-components:my-0 layer-components:leading-normal">
          By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees, in the
          form of recurring fees (subscriptions). Your subscription begins on
          your purchase date, and we'll bill or charge you in the
          automatically-renewing monthly interval (or other interval specified
          by us) until you cancel your subscription. You can cancel your
          subscription at any time by visiting your account settings.
        </p>
        <p class="layer-components:my-0 layer-components:leading-normal">
          <strong>Taxes.</strong> To the extent permitted by law, or unless
          explicitly stated otherwise, all fees do not include applicable
          federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales,
          value-added, goods and services, harmonized or other taxes, fees, or
          charges (“Taxes”). You're responsible for paying all applicable Taxes
          relating to your use of our Services, your payments, or your
          purchases. If we're obligated to pay or collect Taxes on the fees
          you've paid or will pay, you're responsible for those Taxes, and we
          may collect payment from you.
        </p>
        <p class="layer-components:my-0 layer-components:leading-normal">
          <strong>Payment</strong> You must provide accurate and up-to-date
          payment information. By providing your payment information, you
          authorize us to store it until you request deletion. If your payment
          fails, we suspect fraud, or Paid Services are otherwise not paid for
          or paid for on time (for example, if you contact your bank or credit
          card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid
          Services), we may immediately cancel or revoke your access to Paid
          Services without notice to you. You authorize us to charge any updated
          payment information provided by your bank or payment service provider
          (e.g., new expiration date) or other payment methods provided if we
          can't charge your primary payment method.
        </p>
        <p class="layer-components:my-0 layer-components:leading-normal">
          <strong>Automatic Renewal</strong> By enrolling in a subscription, you
          authorize us to automatically charge the then-applicable fees and
          Taxes for each subsequent subscription period until the subscription
          is canceled. If you received a discount, used a coupon code, or
          subscribed during a free trial or promotion, your subscription will
          automatically renew for the full price of the subscription at the end
          of the discount period. This means that unless you cancel a
          subscription, it'll automatically renew and we'll charge your payment
          method(s). You must cancel at least one month before the scheduled end
          date of any annual subscription and at least 24 hours before the end
          of any shorter subscription period. The date for the automatic renewal
          is based on the date of the original purchase and cannot be changed.
          If you've purchased access to multiple services, you may have multiple
          renewal dates.
        </p>
        <p class="layer-components:my-0 layer-components:leading-normal">
          You can view your renewal date(s), cancel, or manage subscriptions in
          your settings.
        </p>
        <p class="layer-components:my-0 layer-components:leading-normal">
          <strong>Fees and Changes</strong> We may change our fees at any time
          in accordance with these Terms and requirements under applicable law.
          This means that we may change our fees going forward, start charging
          fees for Services that were previously free, or remove or update
          features or functionality that were previously included in the fees.
          If you don't agree with the changes, you must cancel your Paid
          Service.

          changes to our Services (e.g., adding new features or benefits to our
          Services or retiring certain features of certain Services) or for
          legal, regulatory, or security reasons. If we do this, we'll provide
          notice of the changes, such as by posting the amended Terms and
          updating the “Last Updated” date or, if the changes, in our sole
          discretion, are material, we may notify you through our Services or
          other communications. Any changes will apply on a going-forward basis,
          and, unless we say otherwise, the amended Terms will be effective
          immediately. By continuing to use our Services after we've notified
          you, you agree to be bound by the new Terms. You have the right to
          object to any changes at any time by ceasing your use of our Services
          and may cancel any subscription you have.

          Termination

          We may terminate your access to all or any part of our Services at any
          time, with or without cause or notice, effective immediately,
          including if we believe, in our sole discretion, that you have
          violated this Agreement, any service guidelines, or other applicable
          terms. We have the right (though not the obligation) to (i) reclaim
          your username or website's URL due to prolonged inactivity, (ii)
          refuse or remove any content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates
          any part of this Agreement or any Rout policy, or is in any way
          harmful or objectionable, (iii) ask you to make adjustments, restrict
          the resources your website uses, or terminate your access to the
          Services, if we believe your website's storage or bandwidth usage
          burdens our systems (which is rare and typically only occurs when a
          website is used for file sharing or storage), or (iv) terminate or
          deny access to and use of any of our Services to any individual or
          entity for any reason. We will have no obligation to provide a refund
          of any fees previously paid. You can stop using our Services at any
          time, or, if you use a Paid Service, you can cancel at any time,
          subject to the Fees, Payment, and Renewal section of these Terms.

          You agree that our ability to provide our Services to you is subject
          to compliance with US sanctions that restrict or prohibit who or from
          where our Services can be accessed. By using the Services, you
          represent and warrant that you (i) are not located or residing in any
          country or territory subject to comprehensive US sanctions (currently
          Cuba, Crimea, Iran, North Korea, Donetsk People's Republic, Luhansk
          People's Republic, and Syria); (ii) are not listed on any United
          States list of prohibited or restricted parties, such as OFAC's
          Specially Designated Nationals and Persons List, or otherwise subject
          to US sanctions that would prohibit your access to or use of our
          Services; and (iii) shall not use or allow access by any of your
          customers or potential customers (if applicable) to the Services in
          any manner that may cause Rout to violate US export controls and
          sanctions. We reserve the right to restrict or block your access, or
          access by any of your customers or potential customers (if
          applicable), to the Services and/or to terminate the Agreement at any
          time without notice if we determine, at our sole discretion, that such

          export controls or sanctions.

          The Agreement (together with any other terms we provide that apply to
          any specific Service) constitutes the entire agreement between Rout
          and you concerning our Services. If any part of the Agreement is
          unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part is severable from the
          Agreement, and does not affect the validity or enforceability of the
          rest of the Agreement. A waiver by either party of any term or
          condition of the Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance,
          will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach
          thereof. Rout may assign its rights under the Agreement without
          condition. You may only assign your rights under the Agreement with
          our prior written consent.
